# Line Follower Robot

This project is an Arduino-based line follower robot built as part of the **Makerspace Laboratory (IC152)** course at IIT Indore. The robot follows a black line on a white surface using infrared (IR) sensors and motor control logic.

## üîß Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensor Modules
- L298N Motor Driver
- BO Motors (x4)
- 3D Printed Wheels
- Laser-Cut Acrylic Chassis
- Li-ion Battery
- Jumper Wires, Castor Wheel, Switches

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

IR sensors detect the black line by comparing reflected IR light. Sensor output is processed by the Arduino, which sends PWM signals to the motor driver to control direction and speed accordingly. Differential drive logic is used for turns and alignment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- Autonomous line-following capability
- Custom 3D printed and laser-cut mechanical parts
- Adjustable speed via PWM
- Modular wiring with easy debugging
- Fully coded in Embedded C using Arduino IDE


## üß† Key Learnings

- IR sensor calibration and signal conditioning
- Embedded system programming in C
- Motor driver integration and PWM control
- Circuit wiring and debugging
- Mechanical design using 3D and laser printing
- Collaborative prototyping and documentation
